O, GitHub, your README.md template irks me.

I imagine that in the future, more information will adorn this file.

In the meantime, I will state that I value correctness, elegance, and good documentation, that I generally use Haskell and Agda, and that if you use permissive licenses, then you can request my help.  I might surprise you.

Also, I *am* at least *somewhat* active with this account.  The contribution graph is just not terribly accurate; I use a nonsense e-mail address for some of my commits.

Anyone who has questions about my work is free to create an issue or send a message via XMPP to ach@jabb3r.org.  Also, as indicated by some of my more recent commits, I can also be reached via e-mail at andrewchawk@protonmail.com.
