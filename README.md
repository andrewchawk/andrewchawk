O, GitHub, your README.md template irks me.

i imagine that in the future, more information will adorn this file.

In the meantime, i will state that I value correctness, elegance, and good documentation, that i generally use Haskell and Agda, and that if you use permissive licenses, then you can request my help.  i might surprise you.

Also, i *am* at least *somewhat* active with this account.  The contribution graph is just not terribly accurate; i use a nonsense e-mail address for some of my commits.

Anyone who has questions about my work is free to create an issue or send a message via XMPP to ach@jabb3r.org.  Also, as indicated by some of my more recent commits, i can also be reached via e-mail at andrewchawk@protonmail.com.

i also go by "nakni" but saw no great spot for this mention.
